## Creative
### [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) ![Paid][Paid]
Faster and cheaper alternative to Adobe Photoshop. I don't work with photos, but this covers everything I need.

### [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) ![Paid][Paid]
Faster and cheaper alternative to Adobe Illustrator. Pretty nice to work with!

The icons ![Paid][Paid] ![Upgrade][Upgrade] ![Open-Source][Open-Source] are all made with this program.

### [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/) ![Paid][Paid]
Competitor for InDesign. I've never had to use it, but I bought it with the Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer.

### [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
The best substitute to Adobe Premiere. I use it because it's free, and because it's the best video editing alternative to Adobe Premiere.

### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Awesome software for making 3D anything.

## Code
### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
The text editor I've loved over the years for it's speed. It's fast. It has a wide range of features, but speed is the primary reason I use this. Other GUI editors compare slow to Sublime Text.

### [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
Hands down, the best Git client I've used. I even prefer this over the terminal.

### GameMaker: Studio 1.4 ![Paid][Paid]
Can no longer be bought, but I'd like to have this in the list still.

Stupid but powerful game making engine. I've made a couple small games with this. Also I started working on an extension to the standard library.

### [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Basically combines all shells into one program (CMD, PowerShell, whatever). Still buggy and I've run into issues with it. Still cool though, and I use it daily!

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
All-purpose editor. Very neat. Highly suggest you get.

### [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) ![Paid][Paid]
IDE for web development. I was originally not happy to switch from my other tools, because I thought PhpStorm was a bit clunky.

But holy crap is this tool powerful. I manage my PHP code, SSH connections, and database all through this tool. Love this. It saved my butt multiple times.

### [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/)
To manage JetBrains software, a good compliment when you have their other software.

### [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
The best file transfer software for Windows. Is trash compared to the mac-only Transmit.

## Audio
I have a somewhat advanced (read: stupid) audio setup at home. Let me walk you through it.

### [Voicemeeter Potato](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm) ![Paid][Paid]
This is the central core of whole audio setup.

I have two speakers, and one microphone with audio output for my headphones. With Voicemeeter I can adjust the audio levels of the devices separately. Usually my speakers are muted, the the audio is always active through the microphone output. The volume keyboard buttons control the speaker volume, and the knob on the microphone itself decide the volume in my headphones.

Now, the whole point of this is that I can pass through separate channels, meaning I can have my music only be played through my headphones.

Once upon a time I wanted to record gameplay (yeah...) but I still wanted to listen to music while doing so. With this configuration I was able to do so (by also using Virtual Audio Cable and Audio Router).

This was a long time ago, but I really liked the flexibility of the setup so I kept at it.

Note: There are 3 versions of Voicemeeter; Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato respectivelt. The first two variants are nagware, meaning you'll get an occasional popup to buy the software. I did not pay for this for a long time, but seeing how big part of my daily routine this was I did the right thing and bought the full, potato, version. 

### [Virual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
Adds "virtual" inputs/outputs. If you pass through audio through the virtual input it gets passed to the virtual output. This now acts as its own device. This meant when I recorded my gameplay I could have the audio play through a specific device, and not record that onto the video's audio track.

### [Audio Router](https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
As the final ingredient in the streaming mix. This allows me to change which output device programs are using.

In combination with Voicemeeter, Virtual Audio Cable, and my recording software, I would do the following:

1. Change Spotify output channel to Virtual Cable 1 (VA1).
2. Make sure the recording software did not use VA1 when recording.
3. Pass through VA1 into my headphones only.

This meant I could record gameplay with gameplay audio on one track, my voice onto another, and finally have music played only through my headphones.

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Simple audio recording software.

### [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
When I need to play music files locally. Might switch back to classic Winamp though.

## Games
I used to play a lot of games.

### [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
It's Steam.

### [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy)
GOG (formerly Good Old Games) sells games DRM-free. When a developer publishes a game here, they know the risk of the game getting pirated. So often I'll buy a game here a second time. for teh lulz.

### [Discord](https://discord.com/)
To communicate with my fellow games. Usually I'll just hang out and talk with friends.

## Other
I couldn't really fit these into their own categories without making the category list only have about one to two items in it. So here we go.

### [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
Insanely powerful, insanely flexibe, insanely stupid. Allows me to write custom scripts to "do things" with my compuer. I have a few always running scripts, which you can [view here](https://github.com/vladdeSV/my-ahk-scripts).

### [MailBird](https://www.getmailbird.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
I've tried a lot of mail clients, and nothing comes close to MailBird. Seriously.

### [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/en/download/windows/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
I listen to music. I have Spotify Premium. Neat.

### [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)
Unsure exactly, but I believe it's "simulating protein dynamics", to help researches cure cancer and other diseases (like COVID-19). I fold for the LTT group, and you can check me out [here](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/vladdeSV). 

### [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
ZIP software. It handles .zip, .rar, and .7z files. And it's free.

### [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)
Get information about your system.

### [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/)
Get even more information about your system.

### [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/)
Visualize all files and their sizes. Helps me track down large files and folders in my sytem.

### [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Torrent client, for when you need to download GIMP by other means than direct download.
