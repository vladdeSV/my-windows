## Creative
### [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) ![Paid][Paid]
Faster and cheaper alternative to Adobe Photoshop. I don't work with photos, but this covers everything I need.

### [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) ![Paid][Paid]
Faster and cheaper alternative to Adobe Illustrator. Pretty nice to work with!

The icons ![Paid][Paid]! [Upgrade][Upgrade] ![Open-Source][Open-Source] are all made with this program.

### [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/) ![Paid][Paid]
Competitor for InDesign. I've never had to use it, but I bought it with the Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer.

### [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
The best substitute to Adobe Premiere. I use it because it's free, and because it's the best video editing alternative to Adobe Premiere.

### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Awesome software for making 3D anything.

## Code
### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
The text editor I've loved over the years for it's speed. It's fast. It has a wide range of features, but speed is the primary reason I use this. Other GUI editors compare slow to Sublime Text.

### [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
Hands down, the best Git client I've used. I even prefer this over the terminal.

### GameMaker: Studio 1.4 ![Paid][Paid]
Can no longer be bought, but I'd like to have this in the list still.

Stupid but powerful game making engine. I've made a couple small games with this. Also I started working on an extension to the standard library.

### [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Basically combines all shells into one program (CMD, PowerShell, whatever). Still buggy and I've run into issues with it. Still cool though, and I use it daily!

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
All-purpose editor. Very neat. Highly suggest you get.

### [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) ![Paid][Paid]
IDE for web development. I was originally not happy to switch from my other tools, because I thought PhpStorm was a bit clunky.

But holy crap is this tool powerful. I manage my PHP code, SSH connections, and database all through this tool. Love this. It saved my butt multiple times.

### [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/)
To manage JetBrains software, a good compliment when you have their other software.

### [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
The best file transfer software for Windows. Is trash compared to the mac-only Transmit.

## Audio
My audio related software. Both input and output.

### [Voicemeeter Potato](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm) ![Paid][Paid]
### [Virual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
### [Audio Router](https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Simple audio recording software

### [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
When I need to play music files locally. Might switch back to classic Winamp though.

## Games
I used to play a lot of games.

### [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
It's Steam.

### [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy)
GOG (formerly Good Old Games) sells games DRM-free. When a developer publishes a game here, they know the risk of the game getting pirated. So often I'll buy a game here a second time. for teh lulz.

### [Discord](https://discord.com/)
To communicate with my fellow games. Usually I'll just hang out and talk with friends.

## Other
I couldn't really fit these into their own categories without making the category list only have about one to two items in it. So here we go.

### [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
Insanely powerful, insanely flexibe, insanely stupid. Allows me to write custom scripts to "do things" with my compuer. I have a few always running scripts, which you can [view here](https://github.com/vladdeSV/my-ahk-scripts).

### [MailBird](https://www.getmailbird.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
I've tried a lot of mail clients, and nothing comes close to MailBird. Seriously.

### [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/en/download/windows/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
I listen to music. I have Spotify Premium. Neat.

### [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)
Unsure exactly, but I believe it's "simulating protein dynamics", to help researches cure cancer and other diseases (like COVID-19). I fold for the LTT group, and you can check me out [here](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/vladdeSV). 

### [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
