## Creative
### [Affinity Photo 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) ![Paid][Paid]
Faster and cheaper alternative to Adobe Photoshop. I don't usually work with photos, but this covers everything I need.

### [Affinity Designer 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) ![Paid][Paid]
Faster and cheaper alternative to Adobe Illustrator. Pretty nice to work with!

The icons ![Paid][Paid] ![Upgrade][Upgrade] ![Open-Source][Open-Source] are all made with this program.

### [Affinity Publisher 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/) ![Paid][Paid]
Competitor for Adobe InDesign. I used it to create easily printable [PDF's for cards from Inscryption](https://cards.vladde.me/).

### [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
The best substitute to Adobe Premiere. I use it because it's free, and because I do not like Adobe.

### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Awesome software for making 3D anything.

## Code
### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
The text editor I've loved over the years for its speed. It's fast. It has a wide range of features, but speed is the primary reason I use this. Other GUI editors compare slow to Sublime Text.

### [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
Hands down, the best Git client I've used. I even prefer this over the terminal.

### GameMaker: Studio 1.4 ![Paid][Paid]
Can no longer be bought, but I'd like to have this in the list still.

Stupid but powerful game making engine. I've made a couple small games with this. Also I started working on an [extension to the standard library](https://github.com/vladdeSV/gm_extensions).

### [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Combines all shells into one window (WSL, CMD, PowerShell, etc).

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
All-purpose editor. Very neat. Highly suggest you get.

### [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
The best file transfer software for Windows. It is trash compared to the mac-only Transmit.

## Audio
I have a somewhat advanced (read: stupid) audio setup at home. Let me walk you through it.

### [Voicemeeter Potato](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm) ![Paid][Paid]
This is the central core of whole audio setup.

I have two speakers, and one microphone with audio output for my headphones. With Voicemeeter I can adjust the audio levels of the devices separately. Usually, my speakers are muted, then the audio is always active through the microphone output. The volume keyboard buttons control the speaker volume, and the knob on the microphone itself decide the volume in my headphones.

Now, the whole point of this is that I can pass through separate channels, meaning I can have my music only be played through my headphones.

Once upon a time I wanted to record gameplay (yeah...), but I still wanted to listen to music while doing so. With this configuration I was able to do so (by also using Virtual Audio Cable and Audio Router).

This was a long time ago, but I really liked the flexibility of the setup, so I kept at it.

Note: There are 3 versions of Voicemeeter; Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato respectively. The first two variants are nagware, meaning you'll get an occasional popup to buy the software. I did not pay for this for a long time, but seeing how big part of my daily routine this was I did the right thing and bought the full, potato, version.

### [Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
Adds "virtual" inputs/outputs. If you pass through audio through the virtual input it is passed to the virtual output. This now acts as its own device. This meant when I recorded my gameplay I could have the audio play through a specific device and not have it recorded onto the video's audio track.

### [Audio Router](https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
As the final ingredient in the streaming mix. This allows me to change which output device programs are using.

In combination with Voicemeeter, Virtual Audio Cable, and my recording software, I would do the following:

1. Change Spotify output channel to Virtual Cable 1 (VA1).
2. Make sure the recording software did not use VA1 when recording.
3. Pass through VA1 into my headphones only.

This meant I could record gameplay with gameplay audio on one track, my voice onto another, and finally have music played only through my headphones.

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Simple audio recording software.

### [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
When I need to play music files locally. Might switch back to classic Winamp though.

## Games
I used to play a lot of games.

### [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
It's Steam.

### [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy)
GOG (formerly Good Old Games) sells games DRM-free. When a developer publishes a game here, they know the risk of the game getting pirated. So often I'll buy a game here a second time. for teh lulz.

### [Discord](https://discord.com/)
To communicate with my fellow gamers. Usually I'll just hang out and talk with friends.

## Other
I couldn't really fit these into their own categories without making the category list only have one to two items in it. So here we go.

### [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
Insanely powerful, insanely flexible, insanely stupid. Allows me to write custom scripts to "do things" with my computer. I have a few always running scripts, which you can [view here](https://github.com/vladdeSV/my-ahk-scripts).

### [MailBird](https://www.getmailbird.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
I've tried a lot of mail clients, and nothing comes close to MailBird. Seriously.

### [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/en/download/windows/) ![Upgrade][Upgrade]
I listen to music. I have Spotify Premium. Neat.

### [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
I never liked Microsoft Edge, but after they switched to using Chromium and I gave it a go, it turned out I like it far more than any other browser.

If I were to describe it, I would say it combined the good parts from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

### [Firefox Browser Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Variant of Mozilla Firefox specfically for web-development. Not entirely sure what the differences are from the standard broweser, but I keep it as a second browser.

I was a long time user of Google Chrome, but switched to Firefox because I was a tiny bit fed up with the forced UI changes that came with Google Chrome version 69 (not very nice).

I do have a litte bit of a soft spot for Mozilla though.

### [1Password](https://1password.com/) ![Paid][Paid]
Keeps my passwords. Makes my life much easier. Available as an extension to webbrowsers, and as an app for phones.

### [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)
Unsure how exactly, but I believe it is "simulating protein dynamics" to help researches cure cancer and other diseases (like COVID-19). I fold for the LTT group, and you can check me out [here](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/vladdeSV).

### [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
> HxD is a [...] hex editor

It's free, it works, and I like it.

### [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
ZIP software. It handles .zip, .rar, and .7z files. And it's free.

### [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)
Get information about your system.

### [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/)
Get even more information about your system.

### [WizTree](https://diskanalyzer.com/)

### [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) ![Open-Source][Open-Source]
Torrent client, for when you need to download GIMP or Linux ISO's by other means than direct download.
